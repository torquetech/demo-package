# Torque Demo Package

The primary purpose of this package is to demonstrate the capabilities of Torque â€” how easy it is to maintain complex cloud architectures with Torque: set up new workspaces, add new architectural components to existing workspaces, and deploy to new or existing environments. The Demo Package components, links, and providers might miss some functionality related to the ease of coding or the breadth of configuring. But, if you like how easy it is to maintain complex cloud architectures with Torque, please let us know, and we will help you get what you need in terms of functionality.

## Prerequisites

For the `demo-package` to work properly, make sure you have the following tools installed and configured in your development and CI/CD environments:

1. [Docker](https://docs.docker.com/get-docker/)
2. [docker-compose](https://docs.docker.com/compose/install/)
3. [Terraform](https://learn.hashicorp.com/tutorials/terraform/install-cli)
4. [kubectl](https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/tools/)
5. [Helm](https://helm.sh/docs/intro/install/)

## Components

### `demo/python-app`

A Python deployable unit that does not expose the network connectivity option. Used for background jobs, single-use scripts, and similar. It can be linked to other components using python or network-based links.

#### Parameters

- `path` - Subdirectory where the code scaffolding will be generated. For example `path=my-app`

#### Configuration

- `development_mode` - When set to `true`, tells the component to use a Dockerfile for local development that mounts the app directory and runs the app in watch (live-reload) mode.
- `environment` - key/value dictionary of environment variables passed to the docker container.

#### Code Scaffolding

```text
.my-app
|-- app
|   `-- __init__.py
|   `-- __main__.py
|-- modules
|   `-- __init__.py
|-- Dockerfile
|-- Dockerfile.dev
|-- requirements.txt
|-- setup.py
|-- version.sh
```

There is no specific code or framework present in the `demo/python-app`. But you can imagine how we can convert it into any particular use case by extending its Python class and overriding the `on_create` method to add additional code scaffolding.

- `app` directory: Put all your code here and invoke it from the `__main__.py` file.
- `modules` directory: Used by links to put their modules and dependencies.

#### Local Development

We recommend setting the `development_mode` flag to `true` when configuring the local development profiles. This way the component will use `Dockerfile.dev` docker image that mounts the local app directory and runs the app directly from your code.

### `demo/python-service`

Inherited from [`demo/python-app`](#demopython-app), it is a Python deployable unit that exposes an HTTP connectivity option. Other apps and services can connect to it and use its API. Used for backend services.

Everything else is the same as the [`demo/python-app`](#demopython-app) component.

### `demo/postgres`

PostgreSQL database instance. This component does not have a dedicated directory in the workspace.

#### Configuration

- `version` - PostgreSQL version to use. Default 14.2
- `password` - A root user password. You can set it yourself, or when left blank, the system will generate a random password.

### `demo/zookeeper`

According to https://zookeeper.apache.org/, ZooKeeper is a centralized service for maintaining configuration information, naming, providing distributed synchronization, and providing group services. In the context of the Torque Demo package, ZK is required by the [`demo/kafka`](#demokafka) component.

This component does not have a dedicated directory in the workspace.

### `demo/kafka`

According to https://kafka.apache.org/, Apache Kafka is an open-source distributed event streaming platform used by thousands of companies for high-performance data pipelines, streaming analytics, data integration, and mission-critical applications. In other words, a powerful, but complex piece of technology. In the context of the Torque Demo package, we wanted to show how usage of a complex service can be simplified when described as a Torque component.

This component does not have a dedicated directory in the workspace.

### `demo/persistent-volume`

Whenever you have a Docker container that stores data, and you want to keep that data beyond the container's lifespan (so it is not destroyed together with the container), you need to mount a persistent volume to the container. 
This component does not have a dedicated directory in the workspace.

#### Parameters

- `size` - Storage size in GB.

### `demo/load-balancer`

Whenever services and apps need to be accessed from the internet, or they need to know the URL that services are exposed to the internet (like react app), we need to link them to a load balancer component.

This component does not have a dedicated directory in the workspace.

#### Configuration

- `host` - A URL where linked service components are exposed.

### `demo/react-app`

The `demo/react-app` code was generated using the `create-react-app` utility. It includes everything required to run the react app locally inside a docker image and then deploy it to a _Kubernetes_ cluster.

#### Parameters

- `path` - Subdirectory where the code scaffolding will be generated. For example `path=my-app`

#### Configuration

- `development_mode` - When set to `true`, tells the component to use a Dockerfile for local development that mounts the `app` directory and runs the app in watch (reload) mode.

#### Code Scaffolding

```text
.my-service
|-- src
|   `-- App.css
|   `-- App.test.tsx
|   `-- App.tsx
|   `-- index.css
|   `-- index.tsx
|   `-- logo.svg
|-- .dockerignore
|-- .gitignore
|-- devel.sh
|-- Dockerfile
|-- Dockerfile.dev
|-- package.json
|-- package-lock.json
|-- README.md
|-- tsconfig.json
```

- `src` directory: Put all your app code here.

#### Local Development

We recommend setting the `development_mode` flag to `true` when configuring the local development profiles. This way the component will use `Dockerfile.dev` docker image that mounts the local app directory and runs the app directly from your code.

## Links

### `demo/network`

A link that connects a service component with other services and apps. This link is used later by a provider to set up the network URL environment variable to the destination component container.

#### Destination container environment variables

- `{COMPONENT_NAME}_LINK` - a URL to the source service component.

### `demo/psycopg`

Extends a network link and provides a connection between a PostgresSQL database component and Python services and apps. This link adds code scaffolding for database connection and sets up required environment variables to the destination component container.

#### Destination container environment variables

- `{COMPONENT_NAME}_PSYCOPG_DB` - a PostgreSQL database name.
- `{COMPONENT_NAME}_LINK` - a URL to the PostgreSQL database instance.
- `{COMPONENT_NAME}_PSYCOPG_USER` - a PostgreSQL database user name.
- `{COMPONENT_NAME}_PSYCOPG_PASSWORD` - a PostgreSQL database user password.

### `demo/volume`

Components that store data usually need some form of volume mounted in order to ensure data is not lost after their service containers are restarted. The volume link sets the volume path to the destination component so a provider can correctly set up the mount point for the container.

### `demo/postgres-data`

Extends the demo/volume link to set the mount point as a PostgreSQL container data mount.

### `demo/zookeeper-data`

Extends the [`demo/volume`](#demovolume) link to set the mount point as a Zookeeper container data mount.

### `demo/kafka-data`

Extends the [`demo/volume`](#demovolume) link to set the mount point as a Kafka container data mount.

### `demo/zookeeper-kafka`

A link that connects a [`demo/zookeeper`](#demozookeeper) component with a [`demo/kafka`](#demokafka) component. The [`demo/kafka`](#demokafka) component uses this link to set up a connection to Zookeeper.

### `demo/kafka-python`

A link that extends the [`demo/network`](#demonetwork) link to connect a [`demo/kafka`](#demokafka) component with Python services and apps. This link adds code scaffolding for both Kafka producer and Kafka consumer connection. The network link part sets the environment variable to the destination component container.

### `demo/ingress`

A link that connects a load balancer component with a component that needs to be connected from internet. Examples are [`demo/python-service`](#demopython-service) and [`demo/react-app`](#demoreact-app).

#### Parameters

- `path` - A URL path where the service (component) will be accessible. For example, setting parameter as `path=/my-app` instructus load balancer component to route all requests coming to `https://my.domain/my-app/*` to the linked component.

#### Destination container environment variables

- `{COMPONENT_NAME}_LINK` - a URL to a service component instance.

## Providers

### `demo/docker-compose`

Generates `docker-compose.yaml` and executes the `docker compose up` command to run all defined services.

### `demo/terraform`

Generates _Terraform HCL_ files. Currently supports only setting up _EBS AWS_ volumes.

### `demo/k8s`

Generates _Helm_ chart files, and applies them to the configured _Kubernetes_ cluster.
